In submitting the following record we are conscious of the fact that we have errors. Some of them have been found and 
corrected by pen even after the stencil had been out. Others, I presume will be found by you. Others will not be 
found, there are none among us today who have lived long enough in the past to know them. It is our sincere desire 
to make this record as accurate as possible. To do this we must have your help. If you fin a mistake kindly notify 
this writer who will in turn correct his copy. It is our intention to rewrite this story, making it more readable by 
including such personal human interest stories as are available; more accurate by correcting the mistakes which you 
may find. The first three pages are taken directly without any changes form the family record as written by cousin 
Ethel Mards Carr Marsh.  We are deeply indebted to here for this information. Without her help it would have been 
impossible to have gone back beyond the parents of Daniel and David. As stated in the history, four Marsh brothers 
came to the colonies some time prior to 1761. How many years before this date it was, we do not know. Samuel Marsh, 
Son of Zebediah Marsh, was born in 1761. We may well imagine that it was several years before his birth. We have 
studied the records of England of their period.  They were perilous years. Many came to America to escape the wrath 
of a tyrant Marsh King, others to escape the judgement of the Puritan Cromwell.
During the period following the death of the great Chief Massaseit, the Indians rose in rebellion.  For the next 100 
years, there was much trouble between the Indians and the Whites. The following incident was taken from a record 
compiled by Aunt Elizabeth (Lizzie) Adkins Marsh and is very interesting. We might well imagine the fate of the Marsh 
family had the Indians been on the Warpath. When four Marsh brothers came from England, they landed in May and got 
lost in the Maine woods.  The Marsh wandered for nine days without any food except wild berries and roots, but finally 
they came to a Marsh Indian wigwam.  The Marsh men could not tell the Indians they were hungry, but the Indians understood 
form their appearance that they were starving.  The Indian squaws made a tea herb and gave each of them a few drops. 
They became very angry for they wanted lots of food but the old squaw would not give it to them.  In a few minutes 
she gave them a few more drops of the tea.  Several times she did this just a little every few minutes until they went 
to sleep.  When they awoke, they were given good gruel.  Of course, they were ravenous, but she didn't give them too 
much at first.  Then she gave them all that they needed and showed them the way out of the woods so that they came to 
a town. I find a note among some papers saying Samuel Sr., son of Zebediah, was a Revolutionary Soldier.  Perhaps one 
of his sons William Marsh or Thomas Marsh may have served in the War of 1812.  I 
believe that William Hanford Marsh, son of Samuel Jr. Marsh, served in the Civil War.  Certainly we know that our own 
Daniel L. served in the 83rd Indiana Volunteers with distinction in the Civil War.  His son Harry Howard Marsh served 
overseas in World War I.  Our records show that Richard Owens Marsh, Great grandson of William Hanford Marsh, was 
lost at Pearl Harbor. Today our hats are off to James Marsh and Charles Adkins Marsh, The great grandsons of Daniel 
Marsh, they have joined the American Marines and have pledged themselves to the defense of our nation against the 
most ruthless enemy the world has ever known.  Our Marsh family has helped and is helping to keep this the land of 
the Free and the land of the Brave. Lately, I have learned something that should make us very proud.  Searching 
through the record of the Mud Pike Baptist Church, which was founded in 1842, Lula B Clark informs me that she 
finds twelve members listed. I do know that Samuel Nelson Marsh and Elizabeth Kelly Marsh are buried there.  The 
church is have a centennial celebration on August. I believe the Marsh family should be represented.  Where better 
could we spend the day then in the church our people helped to build?
